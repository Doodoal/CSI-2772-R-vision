While studying for my C++ exam, I ChatGPT'd a bunch of interactive quizzes to test my knowledge. I wanted to have them all on the go, so I uploaded them here so that I could use Github Pages to publish them, and thus access them easily on my phone.
It also made it easier to share those pages with my study buddies:)

Btw one of those pages - The first one listed, was ChatGPT'd by a friend of a friend... I just added a little styling to it😶‍🌫️
